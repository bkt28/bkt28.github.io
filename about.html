<p id="bio">
I study Information Science and Computer Science at Cornell University and will be
graduating in January 2018 with a concentration in User Experience. During my time at 
Cornell, I have completed coursework covering a variety of topics in computer science 
including object-oriented programming, functional programming, data structures, and 
computer architecture. I am a member of the Association of Computer Science Undergraduates 
and the Information Science Student Association.
<br><br>
For the past two summers, I have interned at 52inc, an amazing app development studio in 
Columbia, South Carolina. At 52inc, I have developed apps for both iOS and Android that 
consume RESTful web services and are implemented using the MVC architecture pattern. I also 
had the opportunity to design interfaces for the apps I built that adhere to the design 
principles of their respective platform.
<br><br>
I served as the Lay Leader of the Protestant community at Cornell, welcoming visitors to 
the chapel and delivering announcements at services each Sunday.
<br><br>
When Iâ€™m not writing code, I enjoy playing the violin and piano, spending time on the 
tennis court, and reading about politics.
